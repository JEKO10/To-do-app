## Project task

My first CRUD app in react. You are able to add, remove, edit and filter completed tasks.


## Project overview

Add, edit, remove and mark completed tasks. You can display only completed/uncompleted tasks. I used filter method for deleting and filtering completed/uncompleted tasks. After adding 3 or more tasks, button for clearing all tasks appears. I used local storage for setting and getting added tasks. Website is fully responsive.

## Built with
